# Assumptions

- We are assuming that patient data is coming from MyMedicalData.
- Should we connect to MonitorThem and upload the collected sensor data that can be used for analytics.
- Only required interfaces are the mobile app (for alerts) and nurse station.
- StayHealthy mobile app is developed separately so its details are out of the scope of this document.
- We assume that patient information is available in MyMedicalData record system.
- We assume that each hospital has a central authentication/authorization mechanism is in place. All MonitorMe services will use this mechanism. And thus authentication is out-of-scope.
